                      <h3>3 Benefits of Grocery Delivery in Today's Life</h3>
                      <p className="description">Grocery delivery sure can take the headache out of filling your fridge, 
                          but what you might not know is those deliveries can actually help you eat healthier, 
                          save time and be a more budget-savvy shopper. 
                          Here are a few noteworthy benefits of grocery delivery to consider 
                          the next time you finish making your next shopping list, 
                          plus some tips to get started using Foodsmart.
                          Healthier food at home. One recent study showed grocery delivery 
                          reduced the overall number of food items in the home, 
                          as well as access to high-fat food options. Without having to pass by aisles of tempting foods, 
                          participants also reported the delivery service led them to make healthier choices. 
                          Fewer impulse purchases. Participants in the same study 
                          reported that home grocery delivery service was easy to use and that 
                          it helped decrease impulse purchases. Good news if you tend to leave the store with way 
                          more than you budgeted for!Fresh food, fast. 
                          Empty fridge? Thanks to grocery delivery services, you can fill your fridge with fresh, 
                          healthy food in as little as one hour. Coming home to a delivery of fresh fruits, 
                          veggies, meats and cheeses and your usual pantry staples gives you far fewer 
                          excuses to turn to fast food after a fun-filled vacation or a crazy day at work.

                      <p className="description">Kale is one of the first garden veggies to produce a crop in early spring. 
                      Depending on the variety and your growing conditions, it can keep growing all season long.

                      Kale grows so prolifically, in fact, that you might not be able to eat all that you produce,

                      <h3>Transport as an Important Factor for a Farmer’s Success</h3>
                      <p className="description">In order to produce food, farmers need certain resources, 
                        such as seed, fertilizers, pesticides, packaging materials, and many others. 
                        Precisely because of that, transport is an essential aspect of crop production 
                        that enables delivery of agricultural resources to a farmer.
                        Furthermore, transport is a burning component of post-harvest crop management.
                        After all, every harvested crop needs to be transported, 
                        either directly from the field to the market, or to the packing house and storage..</p>

                      <h3>Weeds—When Not To Worry</h3>
                      <p className="description">Many people fear weeds. They carry a cultural stigma, and signify failure in the garden or home landscape. 
                          With the growing awareness of invasive plant species, this fear has become almost paralyzing for some. 
                          To dispel that fear, it is best to better understand weeds. Here is a simple two-part perspective on weeds:
                          Weeds are a symptomatic response to a particular type of disturbance.
                          hift or eliminate the disturbance, and the weeds will not recruit again.
                          There’s two things here that work in our favor. 
                          First, weeds need specific types of disturbance to successfully disperse, germinate and thrive. 
                          Most weeds are species of exposed bare soils. They are annuals or biennials that take quick advantage 
                          of resources that are not tied in to the cycles of an established plant community. 
                          They grow, seed and move on, unless the disturbance is repeated. 
                          Annuals and biennials are primarily a threat to the perennial plants we are nurturing or establishing 
                          only when our desired plant community is just a year or two old. 
                          For example, a newly seeded meadow on bare soil could be overwhelmed by annual and biennial weeds in its first couple of years unless managed with intermittent mowing designed to keep weeds at the same height as native seedlings.

                          Most of the commonly known weeds are annuals. 
                          These are the species that show up in the carefully bared soils of vegetable gardens and in 
                          the disturbed soils we create with machinery in the urban and suburban landscape. 
                          They include amaranth, foxtail grass, lamb’s quarters, purslane, galinsoga, smartweed and horseweed. 
                          I’d be remiss not to mention that a large percentage of garden weeds are also good edibles. 
                          We disturb some soil on our farm every year (with the ostensible purpose of a vegetable garden)
                          in part because of the fantastic crop this yields of amaranth and lamb’s quarters, 
                          both exceptional cooked greens. If we didn’t till the soil in this patch,
                          it would rapidly colonize with asters and goldenrods like the meadow just upslope. 
                          Which leads to the another simple precept about weeds: Most annuals and biennials do not 
                          compete effectively with established perennials. Right near our “vegetable garden” (AKA annual weed patch) 
                          is a small planting of tall coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata) that we maintain for its edible greens.
                          It’s specifically desirable because it commences new basal leaf growth very early in the spring. As a green, it is available well before any garden vegetable greens like spinach or lettuce are ready to harvest. 
                          It’s available well before dandelions, even. Here’s a hypothetical scenario. 
                          Let’s say one of the lamb’s quarters seeds from the garden fell across the path and landed in the tall coneflower patch. 
                          While the lamb’s quarters are germinating (often late in spring), 
                          the tall coneflower has basal leaves almost 2 feet across, and is starting to bolt for the season.
                          Maybe it’s a couple of feet tall already. The lamb’s quarters don’t stand a chance. 
                          Even an annual weed that germinates just as tall coneflower begins its growth in March would be 
                          hard-pressed to maintain the growth or access the resources that this well-established native perennial can.
